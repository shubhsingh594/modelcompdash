## OpenWorm Foundation â€“ Model Completion Dashboard

This is a summary of my work on the Model Completion Dashboard application for OpenWorm Foundation, which I undertook as part of GSoC 2017.

#### Background

Efforts have been made to model C.elegans, and data has been collected from research papers and various sources to do so. Now it has become important to record and track progress.
Model Completion Dashboard does exactly this, using PyOpenWorm as a data resource, this application represents the current state of affair for C.elegans modelling. The user can now know at a glance how far we have come in modelling the worm and how far we still have to go.


#### Implementation

Model Completion Dashboard is a django app, which uses reactJS as the frontend technology.
I make use of the django-rest-framework to essentialy expose the PyOpenWorm Api, as a RestFul Api.
The App itself allows the users to drill down on each element and view the state of compeletion as well as what data is missing.So more effort can be made towards populating missing data.

During the project, I also helped in extending PyOpenWorm to have more data about ion channels, sourced from the crowdsourcing platform for C. Elegans ion channels known as ChannelWorm.
